# Plan: IRIS Architecture (Updated)

## Objective
Create a modern, lightweight, and high-performance IITC alternative. Current focus is a **Desktop Proof of Concept (POC)** as a Browser Extension (Manifest V3) that acts as a "Master Map" overlaying the original Ingress Intel map.

## Technical Stack
- **Framework:** Preact (UI) + Zustand (State).
- **Build Tool:** Vite + `vite-plugin-web-extension`.
- **Mapping Engine:** MapLibre GL JS (WebGL-accelerated).
- **Basemap:** CartoDB Positron / OSM (Dynamic Switching).
- **Sync Method:** Bi-directional event bridging between MapLibre and Google Maps (Intel).

## Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Core & Data Capture (100% Complete)
- [x] Monorepo & Extension Skeleton.
- [x] "Main World" Interceptor for `/r/getEntities`, `/r/getPortalDetails`, and `/r/getPlexts`.
- [x] Support for Portals, Links, Fields, and Machina (Red) faction.
- [x] Zero-log performance optimization for high-density areas.
- [x] Automated `getPlexts` triggering on init/move/open with 5s cooldown.
- [x] **Entity Deletion:** Correctly handle `deletedGameEntityGuids` to remove destroyed links/fields.

### Phase 2: Map Rendering (100% Complete)
- [x] MapLibre GL Overlay with OSM Basemap.
- [x] **Bi-directional Sync:** Panning IRIS moves Intel; Intel fetches data -> IRIS renders.
- [x] **Persistent View:** Map stays alive and synced when toggled hidden.
- [x] **Modern Aesthetic:** Dark-Mode by default with faction-themed WebGL layers.
- [x] **Stable Interactions:** Native MapLibre layer events avoided in favor of manual projection for maximum cross-browser stability.
- [x] **Visual Polish:** Portal opacity based on health (0-100%) and faction-colored borders.
- [x] **Data Safety (Optimized):** Initially implemented as redundant renderer checks; now moved to source-side validation in the content script for maximum performance.

### Phase 3: Plugin System (95% Complete)
- [x] SDK Definition: Types for Portals, Links, Fields.
- [x] UI Hooks: `api.ui.addStatsItem` for dynamic overlay content.
- [x] `player-tracker` plugin with movement paths, faction-colored pins, and time-based fading (1h expiration).
- [x] `export-data` plugin for JSON, KML, and GeoJSON exports.
- [x] **Plugin API Expansion:** Exposed `api.utils.normalizeTeam` and `api.ui.getThemeColors` for consistent coloring across plugins.
- [ ] **Next:** Support for custom map layers from plugins.
- [ ] **Next:** Dynamic plugin loading (loading external JS files).
- [ ] **Next:** Migrate **State Debug** to a plugin.
- [ ] **Next:** Migrate **Map Theme** (Theme Picker) to a plugin.

### Phase 4: Refinement & Mobile (100% Complete)
- [x] **UI Polish:** Portal detail popups (clickable portals).
- [x] **Player Name Coloring:** Unified team colors across all UI components (Portals, Comm, Stats).
- [x] **Tabbed COMM:** Dedicated tabs for ALL, FACTION, and ALERTS messages using categories (1, 2, 4).
- [x] **Interactivity in COMM:** Clickable portal names and link events for instant map navigation.
- [x] **Network Monitoring:** Integrated Status Bar with real-time logs for OK/FAILED/JS errors.
- [x] **Faction Consistency:** Unified team normalization (MACHINA/MAC/ALIENS) across entire UI.
- [x] **Fix scrollbar issue:** Resolved redundant scrollbars in `PortalInfoPopup` and other popups.
- [x] **Map Theme Picker:** Added a popup to choose map theme (Light, Dark, Voyager, OSM).
- [x] **Health Filter Evolution:** Replaced the 0-100% range slider with a 4-bucket checkbox system (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) for faster tactical filtering.
- [x] **CSS Centralization:** Migrated inline styles for core UI components (Popup, Topbar, Search, Menus) to a unified `iris.css` to improve maintainability and decouple layout from logic.
- [x] **Enhanced Player Stats:** Switched from DOM-based extraction to `window.PLAYER` interception; added XM capacity, level progress bars, and invite counts.
- [x] **Session Persistence:** Implemented Zustand `persist` middleware to save settings (plugins, themes, etc.) in `localStorage`.
- [x] **COMM Improvements:** Implemented Tab Switching fetch and Periodic Refresh (120s) to match original Intel triggers.
- [x] **Robust COMM Fetching:** Resolved 400 errors by ensuring mandatory map boundaries (`minLatE6`, etc.) are included in all `getPlexts` requests.
- [x] **Modernized Interceptor:** Switched to a unified `fetch`-based request system for IRIS internal calls with proactive version sniffing and background subscription/inventory checks.
- [ ] **Next:** Performance: GeoJSON source throttling for extremely dense areas.
- [ ] **Next:** Mobile Strategy: Decision between Capacitor App vs. Mobile Browser Extension.

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (100% Complete)
- [x] **Player Tracker:** Track player movement based on COMM (plexts) activity. Draw lines between portals for recent activity.
- [x] **Data Export:** Export captured portal/link/field data to standard formats (Plugin).
- [x] **Game Score:** Render GameScore Popup using intercepting `getGameScore` (Standard).
- [x] **Region Score:** Render RegionScoreDetails Popup using intercepting `getRegionScoreDetails` (Standard).
- [x] **Portal History:** Added visual rings for Visited (Purple), Captured (Red), and Scanned (Yellow dashed) status integrated into the map rendering.
- [x] **Inventory Viewer:** High-performance grid view for resonators, weapons, and mods with level-based coloring and C.O.R.E. subscription enforcement.

### Phase 5.5: Intel Feature-Completeness Push (In Progress)
- [x] **Mission Details:** Intercept and render `getMissionDetails` with a mission details popup plus waypoint/route rendering on the IRIS map.
- [x] **Viewport Mission List:** Added a `Missions` menu entry backed by `getTopMissionsInBounds`, with click-through to mission details.
- [x] **Portal Mission Browser:** Added `getTopMissionsForPortal` and a conditional "Missions Starting Here" action in portal details, matching Intel’s portal-flag gating.
- [ ] **Mission Browser Parity:** Refine mission-browser UX to better match Intel, including list/detail transitions, map interaction, and metadata presentation.
- [x] **Artifacts:** Add `getArtifactPortals` parsing and map rendering for shards/targets.
- [ ] **Portal Search:** Implement `/r/getPortalSearch` so IRIS matches Intel’s portal search workflow instead of only address/coordinate search.
- [ ] **COMM Send:** Add `/r/sendPlext` support with an input field in COMM.
- [ ] **Passcodes:** Add `/r/redeemReward` UI and response handling.
- [x] **Login Recovery:** Detect Intel session loss from `401` / `403` and login HTML responses, surface recovery state in the status bar, and suppress repeated auth-failure noise.
- [ ] **Mission UI Polish:** Mission author styling is currently not correctly faction-colored; revisit after establishing a reliable semantic color approach.
- [x] **Font Consistency:** Standardized the IRIS UI onto an explicit Menlo-first monospace stack and forced form controls to inherit it, preventing browser-default Arial from leaking into new mission and popup surfaces.

### Phase 6: Architecture Analysis (100% Complete)
- [x] **Comparative Study:** Exhaustive analysis of original Ingress Intel (`gen_dashboard_*.js`) vs. IRIS, documented in `docs/REF-DESKTOP.MD`.

### Phase 7: Code Quality & Maintenance (100% Complete)
- [x] **Strict Typing:** Removed `any` usage across the codebase, ensuring robust TypeScript coverage for Core, Extension, and Plugins.
- [x] **Linting Infrastructure:** Implemented a modern ESLint configuration (Flat Config) with TypeScript and React/Preact rules.
- [x] **API Consistency:** Refactored `PluginManager` and `store` with explicit return types and interfaces.
- [x] **Typecheck Workflow:** Added a root `npm run typecheck` command (`tsc --noEmit`) and verified it passes.
- [x] **IDE Warning Cleanup:** Resolved current IntelliJ/TypeScript warnings around `unknown` API payloads, optional markup fields, XHR overload typing, redundant boolean coercions, and redundant `typeof` checks.

### Phase 8: Optimization & Architecture (In Progress)
- [x] **Source-side Validation:** Moved all strict numeric parsing and coordinate validation to `parseEntities` to ensure the Zustand store only contains "clean" data.
- [x] **Renderer De-cluttering:** Removed redundant `isNaN` and safety checks from `MapOverlay.tsx`, significantly improving FPS in portal-dense areas.
- [x] **Content/Interceptor Cleanup:** Split content parsing and interception into domain and runtime modules while keeping one shared low-level interception path.
- [x] **Runtime Discipline Pass:** Added explicit session-expiry state, split passive interception from active IRIS-owned fetch execution, introduced a request coordinator, endpoint health tracking, and request-policy cleanup for UI-driven flows.
- [x] **Domain-Oriented Content Layout:** Added per-domain `types`, `parser`, and `handler` modules for entities, portal details, plexts, inventory, player, game score, and region score.
- [x] **Domain-Oriented UI Layout:** Grouped UI components by gameplay domain under `ui/domains/` and moved shared primitives to `ui/shared/`.
- [x] **UI Style Cleanup:** Broke the old monolithic stylesheet into a shared base/topbar split plus domain CSS entrypoints, while keeping `iris.css` as the aggregation entry.
- [x] **Map Feature Builder Extraction:** Moved portal/link/field GeoJSON assembly out of `MapOverlay.tsx` into pure map helper functions.
- [x] **Plugin Marker Diffing:** Replaced full player marker teardown/rebuild with keyed incremental marker updates using stable plugin feature ids.
- [x] **Partial UI CSS Colocation:** Moved scores, plugins, player, status, and map-theme styling into domain-local CSS files while keeping dynamic theme values inline.
- [x] **Store Modularization:** Decomposed the Zustand store into maintainable slices (Settings, Entities, UI, Player, Diagnostics).
- [x] **Persist Scope Cleanup:** Limited Zustand persistence to durable settings and plugin preferences only.
- [x] **Map Interaction Migration:** Migrated to high-performance map interaction using manual projection for cross-browser stability.
- [x] **UI CSS Colocation (Extended):** Finished moving remaining domain-specific popup styling into `ui/domains/*` for `comm` and `inventory`.

#### Identified Performance Bottlenecks
- **GeoJSON Regeneration:** `MapOverlay.tsx` currently iterates over all entities on every state change. 
    - *Strategy:* Implement `source.setData()` throttled updates or offload to a Web Worker.
- **Zustand Selector Overhead:** Multiple complex selectors in `MapOverlay` may trigger redundant Preact re-renders.
    - *Strategy:* Consolidate selectors using shallow equality checks.
- **Map Interaction Overhead:** Click/Hover handlers use $O(n)$ projection loops.
    - *Strategy:* Migrated to MapLibre's native `queryRenderedFeatures` with mobile-optimized proximity fallback.
- **Update Burstiness:** Camera/data sync paths still perform eager updates on several state transitions.
    - *Strategy:* Batch map/source updates behind `requestAnimationFrame` or explicit throttling.

#### Architectural Debt & Improvements
- [x] **Zustand Store Bloat:** Central store mixed core entity state with transient UI toggles.
    - *Status:* Split into logical slices (Entities, UI, Player, etc.).
- [x] **Transient State Persistence Scope:** Runtime-only diagnostics and ephemeral UI/network state were colocated with durable settings.
    - *Status:* Persistence narrowed to settings/plugin preferences only.
- **Map Overlay Monolith:** `ui/domains/map/MapOverlay.tsx` still owns too much rendering, event, and GeoJSON assembly logic.
    - *Strategy:* Continue extracting source update helpers and interaction helpers into map-specific modules.
- [x] **UI Styling Coverage Gap:** The UI folder is now domain-grouped, and popup styling for `comm` and `inventory` has been moved into colocated CSS files.
    - *Status:* Completed for all major domains.
- **Ingress Semantic Color Drift:** Faction colors are mostly aligned, but portal/item semantics such as rarity, powerups, and some inventory color rules are still locally encoded and not standardized against a shared Ingress palette.
    - *Strategy:* Introduce a shared semantic color module for factions, level colors, mod rarity, and inventory/powerup classes, then migrate portal, inventory, COMM, and plugin surfaces to use it consistently.
- **Plugin API Isolation:** Plugins have direct access to core internals.
    - *Strategy:* Implement a restrictive proxy/bridge for the Plugin SDK.
- **Lint Debt Baseline:** ~200 pre-existing errors hindering CI/CD.
    - *Status:* Cleared for current tracked code paths; `npm run lint` now passes.
- **Weak Intel Payload Typing:** Intel endpoint payload parsing still depends on local casts and partial structural assumptions.
    - *Strategy:* Introduce explicit transport/result types for each intercepted endpoint and centralize parse validation.
- **Mission UX Parity Gap:** Mission fetching is implemented, but the popup flow and metadata presentation still do not fully match Intel’s mission browsing feel.
    - *Strategy:* Refine mission list/detail transitions, mission context messaging, and waypoint affordances without coupling mission fetch policy back into the UI.

#### Proposed Next Steps
1. [x] **Map Interaction Sprint:** Replace manual portal click/hover hit-testing with `queryRenderedFeatures`.
2. **GeoJSON Update Optimization:** Throttle or batch `setData()` updates and extract the remaining map source update helpers.
3. [x] **Store Modularization:** Decompose the Zustand store into maintainable slices.
4. [x] **Persist Scope Cleanup:** Limit Zustand persistence to durable settings and plugin preferences.
5. **Payload Typing Pass:** Replace cast-heavy endpoint parsing with explicit validated response types.
6. [x] **UI CSS Colocation:** Finish moving remaining domain-specific popup styling into `ui/domains/*`, starting with `comm` and `inventory`.
7. **Ingress Semantic Palette:** Standardize faction, portal level, rarity, and powerup/item colors in one shared module and migrate current ad hoc color usage to it.
8. **Feature-Completeness Sprint:** Finish the remaining Intel-core basics: portal search, mission browser polish, COMM send, and passcodes.
9. **Post-Runtime Cleanup:** Tighten cache/TTL policy for slow-moving endpoints, keep status diagnostics readable, and continue moving request policy only into the coordinator.

#### Quick Wins
1. **Portal Search:** Implement `/r/getPortalSearch` to close one of the most visible Intel parity gaps.
2. **COMM Send:** Add `/r/sendPlext` for core two-way COMM behavior.
3. **Mission Browser Polish:** Improve mission list/detail UX and metadata styling without changing the now-stable request pipeline.
4. **Semantic Color Palette:** Centralize mission, rarity, powerup, and faction-adjacent colors so new UI surfaces stop encoding colors ad hoc.
5. **Payload Typing Pass:** Add validated transport types for the remaining cast-heavy Intel payloads.

#### Domain Refactor Status
- **Done:** Content/interceptor logic is now split across `domains/` and `runtime/`, with separate game-score and region-score modules for consistency.
- **Done:** UI components are grouped by domain under `ui/domains/`, with shared primitives in `ui/shared/`.
- **Done:** Root workflow checks now include `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build`.
- **Done:** Current IntelliJ/TypeScript warnings that were blocking day-to-day work have been cleaned up.
- **Done:** Portal/link/field GeoJSON builders now live in dedicated map helper modules.
- **Done:** Plugin player markers are updated incrementally rather than rebuilt wholesale.
- **Done:** Scores, plugins, player, status, and map-theme UI now have colocated domain CSS files.
- **Done:** Mission details and viewport mission list are now wired as first-class content/UI features.
- **Done:** Split the Zustand store into slices and narrow what gets persisted.
- **Done:** Migrated to high-performance map interaction using `queryRenderedFeatures` with mobile stability refinements.
- **Done:** Converted the remaining popup/domain styling into colocated CSS files for `comm` and `inventory`.
- **Done:** Implemented artifacts parsing and map layers.
- **Done:** Added session-expiry detection/recovery UI, request coordination, endpoint health diagnostics, and score endpoint TTL/in-flight deduplication.
- **Todo:** Finish map-specific helper extraction from `MapOverlay.tsx`, especially interaction and source update helpers.
- **Todo:** Add a shared Ingress semantic color palette so faction, level, rarity, and powerup/item colors match Ingress conventions consistently across UI surfaces.
- **Todo:** Tighten Intel payload/result typing to reduce residual cast-heavy parsing.
- **Todo:** Complete the remaining Intel-core feature gaps around portal search, mission browsing polish, COMM send, and passcodes.

#### Domain Split Rules
- Keep one shared low-level XHR/fetch interception runtime. Do not create a separate patcher per domain.
- Route requests/responses to domain handlers based on endpoint name.
- Keep each domain self-contained: transport types, parser, state write logic, and request helpers live together.
- Keep cross-domain concerns in `runtime/` only: window messaging, interception hooks, version sniffing, and shared request plumbing.

│   └── topbar.css
├── Overlay.tsx
├── iris.css
└── theme.ts
```

#### UI Split Rules
- Group domain-specific UI and domain-specific styling together.
- Keep reusable primitives like `Popup` and `Topbar` in `shared/`.
- Keep `theme.ts` and design tokens centralized.
- Use `iris.css` as the aggregation entry point that imports shared and domain stylesheets.

## Next Strategic Priority
1. **Portal Search**: Add `/r/getPortalSearch` so the existing search UX covers Intel’s portal lookup flow as well as OSM/geocode jumps.
2. [x] **Artifacts**: Implement `getArtifactPortals` parsing and map layers so shard events are visible.
3. **Mission Parity**: Add `getTopMissionsForPortal` and refine mission details/list styling, including fixing author coloring.
4. **COMM Send**: Add an input field to `CommPopup` for sending messages via `/r/sendPlext`.
5. **Robust Login Detection**: Monitor for `401/403` status codes in `interceptor.ts` to detect session expiry and guide recovery.
6. **Passcodes**: Add a simple passcode redemption UI backed by `/r/redeemReward`.

## Known Issues & Mobile Challenges

| Environment | Issue | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Mobile Firefox** | **Player Tracker Missing:** Markers/Lines are not appearing on mobile builds despite working on desktop. | *Investigating* |
| **Mobile Firefox** | **Stale COMM Messages:** Initial COMM fetch on messages often returns very old messages compared to desktop chrome/firefox. | *Note: Likely due to Intel initial response definition* |
| **All Firefox** | **Security Restrictions:** Accessing `.constructor` on MapLibre objects is blocked. | *Mitigated via manual interaction layer* |
| **All Browsers** | **Login Detection:** Silent failure when session expires. | *Strategy: Monitor 401/403 in interceptor* |
| **All Browsers** | **Subscription Check:** Missing C.O.R.E detection for Inventory. | *Strategy: Extract from window.PLAYER* |

## Current Working Logic
1. **Intercept:** Catch raw JSON from Niantic (XHR/Fetch). Monitor for session-loss status codes.
2. **Strict Parsing:** All incoming entity data is normalized and explicitly cast to numbers to ensure WebGL stability.
3. **Store:** Normalize into Zustand (`@iris/core`). Handles adds, updates, and deletions.
4. **Master Sync:** MapLibre (top layer) captures user input, sends `move` commands to the Google Maps instance.
5. **Subscription Logic:** Guard C.O.R.E.-only features (Inventory, History) behind subscription checks extracted from `window.PLAYER`.
6. **Proactive Trigger:** IRIS triggers its own API calls (e.g., `getPlexts`) on map movement with 5s cooldown.
7. **Monitoring:** All network and JS errors are surfaced in the Status Bar.

## Verification & Testing
- **Network:** Cooldown logic prevents request spam. Dual-tab polling (all/faction) for COMM.
- **Accuracy:** Native MapLibre layer events avoided in favor of manual projection for maximum cross-browser stability.
- **Types:** Strict TypeScript validation across all plugins and core logic.
- **Workflow:** `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build` are part of the expected post-change verification flow.

### Best quick wins from the current codebase:

1. [x] Replace manual hit-testing with manual projection (Safer for Firefox/Mobile)
   `packages/extension/src/ui/domains/map/MapOverlay.tsx`
2. [x] Narrow persisted Zustand state
   `packages/core/src/store.ts`
3. [x] Start store slice extraction
   `packages/core/src/store.ts`
4. [x] **Finish UI CSS colocation for `comm` and `inventory`**
   `packages/extension/src/ui/domains/*`
5. [x] **Implement artifacts parsing and map layers**
   `packages/extension/src/content/domains/artifacts/*`
6. Add a shared Ingress semantic color palette
   `packages/extension/src/ui/theme.ts`
   `packages/extension/src/ui/domains/portal/*`
   `packages/extension/src/ui/domains/inventory/*`
   Standardize faction, level, rarity, and powerup/item colors instead of keeping those decisions spread across components and CSS.
7. Extract remaining map helpers
   `packages/extension/src/ui/domains/map/MapOverlay.tsx`
   Feature builders are already out. The next safe split is source update helpers and portal interaction helpers.
8. Tighten remaining payload typing
   `packages/extension/src/content/domains/*`
   Replace the remaining cast-heavy endpoint assumptions with explicit transport/result types per domain.
9. Add batched source updates
   `packages/extension/src/ui/domains/map/MapOverlay.tsx`
   Wrap clustered `setData()` updates behind `requestAnimationFrame` or a small throttle to reduce update burstiness in dense areas.
10. Finish mission-browser parity
   `packages/extension/src/content/domains/missions*`
   `packages/extension/src/ui/domains/missions/*`
   The core viewport mission list exists now; the next low-risk step is portal-scoped mission browsing plus a polish pass on mission metadata, author styling, and map interaction.

If you want the safest shortlist, I’d do this order:

1. [x] persisted state narrowing
2. [x] initial store slice split
3. [x] manual interaction migration
4. [x] `comm` CSS colocation
5. [x] artifacts implementation
6. shared Ingress semantic palette
7. mission-browser parity

Those are the highest signal-to-risk ratio.
